/**
 * Command to execute an attack from one character to another.
 *
 * TODO 4a: Implement execute() and undo()
 *
 * Requirements for execute():
 * 1. Calculate damage: attacker.attack(target)
 * 2. Apply damage: target.takeDamage(calculatedDamage)
 * 3. Store the damage dealt for potential undo
 *
 * Requirements for undo():
 * 1. Heal the target for the amount of damage that was dealt
 * 2. Use target.heal(damageDealt)
 *
 * Note: This is a simplified undo - in a real game, you'd need to
 * restore mana usage, status effects, etc.
